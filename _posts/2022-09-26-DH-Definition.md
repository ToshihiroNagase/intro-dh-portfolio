During the first couple readings of the class, we gained a deeper understanding on the definition of Digital Humanities. The author defines Humanities as "Humanities are academic disciplines in which humans seek understanding of human self-understandings and self-expressions, and of the ways in which people thereby construct and experience the world they live in." The author emphasizes that its more than just humans learning about humans but also humans learning about themselves and their experience in the complex world. By understanding themselves and their own expressions better, they gain context to their personal place in the universe and a better knowledge of the world around them. Everyone uses actions because they have meaning behind their actions. The author coined humans as "bearers of meaning". Making connection between one's meaning to another's allows people to gain a deeper connection to themselves, the world, and humanities. This type of thinking not only allow people to seek the cause of behavior but also the meaning of action.
