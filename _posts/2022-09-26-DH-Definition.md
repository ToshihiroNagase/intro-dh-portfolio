During the first couple readings of the class, we gained a deeper understanding on the definition of Digital Humanities. Throughout the article, the author explores the definition of Humanities. The author defines Humanities as "Humanities are academic disciplines in which humans seek understanding of human self-understandings and self-expressions, and of the ways in which people thereby construct and experience the world they live in." The author emphasizes that its more than just humans learning about humans but also humans learning about themselves and their experience in the complex world. By understanding themselves and their own expressions better, they gain context to their personal place in the universe and a better knowledge of the world around them. Humans can begin to understand cultural differences as well and notice that the live they lead are completelyy different than others. The author also argues humanities as studying people's actions. Everyone uses actions because they have meaning behind their actions. The author coined humans as "bearers of meaning". Making connection between one's meaning to another's allows people to gain a deeper connection to themselves, the world, and humanities. This type of thinking not only allow people to seek the cause of behavior but also the meaning of action. I am curious to learn more about the overall effects of studying humanities has on society? What is the value of studying humanities beyond understanding? What action does it drive?
