In "An Overview of The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire" by Pockock, the author writes an overview that critiques Gibbon and his work. Pockock mostly focuses on the idea of historical narratives, how they are created, where they came from. One of the main points Pockock made was that Narratives, like Gibbons, are complex and can often be misrepresented. Pockock provides an example of how in Gibbons, it seemed like there was only a Roman history, and did not account for how Athens and Sparta degenerated under Macedonian and Roman empires. Another point that Pockock made was that narratives also come from many different places. There is not always a clear connection to how narratives were formed. For example the revelation of the Christian Trinity was after the Platonism ideology that the perception of the godhead might be differentiated into three capacities. As a classics major, This article makes me question other narratives that I have read. How accurate are they? I am now motivated to look into the narratives I read about and look into where they came from and if the readings could be misrepresented in any way.
