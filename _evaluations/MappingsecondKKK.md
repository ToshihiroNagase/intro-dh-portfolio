## Evaluation

The digital humanities project I am interested in looking into is mapping the second Klu Klux Klan. This project was done by Virginia Commonwealth University. The technology involved is a map API that allows the site to display a map. The researchers then gathered data on the geographic locations of the second Klu Klux Klan across decades. The researchers then displayed this data through a Geographic information system. The projectâ€™s goal was to give the user an interactive map that followed a timeline to show how the second Klu Klux Klan spread.  The functions of the map showed the geographic locations of each club and the corresponding year. This map shows that the second Klu Klux Klan began in Birmingham Alabama in 1915 as well as each new club that appears in the following years up to 1940. By putting it on an interactive map, users can also understand how the clubs spread. The project could help answer which regions in the United States gained interest in the second Klu Klux Klan faster. The main strength of this project is the usage of the map. By putting the data in a visually literate fashion, it helps the user easily understand how the second KKK spread. The map provides a better user experience and increases engagement with the tools. Another strength is for each dot, users can click on the dot and learn about where their source for that dote is from. This allows any user to further their understanding of the map if they are interested. One way that this project could be improved is to have a way to show the density of a dot. Because the geographic location seemed to be centered around city/town instead of the exact location, certain dots had many klu klux klan clubs in them. If they also provided a density map that showed different colors for how dense each region was, that could also enhance the user experience.
