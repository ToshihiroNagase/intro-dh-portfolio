## Evaluation

Mapping the Republic of Letters looks into an age before digital communication. They analyze letters from scientific academies that created a network in the 17th and 18th centuries to allow correspondence across continents. They consisted of a variety of topics, anything from new research findings to someone’s travels. Some of the project’s goals are to investigate the reach of the network, the operations of the network, how it changed over time, and its contents. Mapping the Republic of Letters hopes to act as a digital repository for partners to look through, ask questions, utilize data visualization tools, and answer their own questions about the Republic of Letters. For example, the site offers Case Studies on many individuals that were a part of the Republic of Letters. From these letters, researchers are able to gain information about the person’s life as well as the types of people they were connected with and the information they shared. From there, the project can track how ideas and news moved across the world. Mapping the Republic of Letters is based at Stanford University and works alongside groups such as Oxford University, Groupe D’Alembert, CNRS, CKCC, and DensityDesign Research Lab.

The strengths of the Mapping The Republic of Letters project are the vast amount of information it has and the ability to connect people across time. Because the project tracks letters from a couple of centuries, there is a lot of information that is gathered. This opens up the possibility of temporal analysis. Also, because the information they are collecting is from letters, the project gets information on how people were connected. Because some of these letters are across continents, these connections migh only exist in the letters. A con of the project is that it seems to be difficult to use. The repository is not easily accessible from the site and certain parts of it seemed to be intentionally hidden from the public.
